# How to change a Minecraft sound

1. Find the sound that you want to convert in the [SOUNDS.md](SOUNDS.md) file
2. Get an MP3 of whatever sound you want to create
3. Go to <https://www.onlineconverter.com/mp3-to-ogg> and upload your MP3 file and convert it to an OGG
4. MAKE SURE YOU CREATE THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF SUB-FOLDERS! E.g., if the sound file you want to replace says "ambient/cave/cave0.ogg" YOU MUST CREATE an ambient folder, then inside create a cave folder, and then put your custom OGG file there.
5. Done!

Please ask me if this is confusing because I barely understand it either.
